Highlight and eradicate whitespace at the end of the line in Vim.

This plugin will highlight trailing whitespace at the end of the line. This is done in a polite way:

 * You are not currently editing that line (prevents highlighting it as you type)
 * You are not in insert mode

It also introduces a :Trim command that will strip all the trailing white space from a file (or range). This is done in a polite way:

 * Places the cursor back where is started
 * Resets the search highlight back to what it was

TrailerTrash defines `a :Trailer` command to stop showing unwanted whitespace, for those projects where you don't want to start fighting it.

As always, Trailer Trash is polite.
